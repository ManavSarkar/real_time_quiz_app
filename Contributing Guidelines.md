# Contributing Guidelines
Here is a small checklist or path that you should follow to contribute to this project.

1. To implement a feature, always create a new branch.
2. After the implementation of feature, create a pull request and wait for approval.
3. Do not implement more than one feature in one branch.
4. If a feature requires modification of more than 3 files, break it down into more than one feature. Each PR(Pull request) should not have more than 3 files modification/addition.
5. Document the implementation for future reference.
6. Fork the project before contribution.
7. Using AI tools is not prohibited since rewriting same code doesnot help. But should have knowledge of what is being implemented.
8. That's it :)
